Do not report a user who gets disconnected, your partner may have bad internet or we might be having some issues with ISP, browser or our Raah Servers.
Report a user only if he is trolling, looking for sex, spamming or reasons you can justify.
Your phone number, this chat and your partner's phone number will be recorded for moderation purpose..
We do ban a user by their Phone Number, but at times Phone Number  is not good enough to keep reported users away, Raah hopes it's users cooperate in dealing with such trolls.`
